      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Historically, RHQ has had a little bit of a problem with test coverage
      of its various (agent) plugins. There is a multitude of problems with
      testing these but the following two are, IMHO, the main ones:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect4">
      <h5 id="managed-resources"><a class="anchor" href="#managed-resources"></a>Managed Resources</h5>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>You somehow need to have the managed resource available for the plugin
      to connect to (i.e. you need to have the JBoss AS, Postgres or whatever
      your plugin manages). This is always a problem for a clean quick unit
      test. You either somehow need to mock the managed resource (try that
      with Postgres) or you need to have a way of configuring your test to get
      at or start the managed resource. This is where Arquillian certainly can
      come to the rescue with its ability to manage the lifecycle of its
      "containers" (for managed resources that have an Arquillian extension,
      like JBoss AS) but generally this needs to be in the "hands" of the
      tests for each plugin. There are a million ways the plugins talk to
      their managed resources and so trying to come up with a generic solution
      to start, stop and configure them would IMHO create more problems than
      it would solve.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect4">
      <h5 id="setting-up-agent-environment"><a class="anchor" href="#setting-up-agent-environment"></a>Setting up Agent Environment</h5>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>While not even too hard, running your test in RHQ&#8217;s plugin container
      requires a little bit of setup. It is important to realize that if you
      want your tests to be run inside a real plugin container (i.e. "almost
      an RHQ agent"), it is not enough to have your dependencies on your test
      classpath. The thing is that the plugin container is a container of its
      own - it has its own deployment requirements and classloading policies.
      It is best to think about deploying a plugin into RHQ agent as deploying
      a webapp into Tomcat - you wouldn&#8217;t expect to be able to test the webapp
      in Tomcat just by virtue of having them both on the classpath and
      starting Tomcat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>So to put it straight, you need to jump through some maven and antrun
      hoops to package your plugin (and any other plugin it depends on) and
      put them in defined locations, where the plugin container can then pick
      them from. Also, if you want to take advantage of our native APIs to
      obtain running processes, etc., you need to use another bucket of
      <code>antrun</code> incantations in your POM to set that up.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect4">
      <h5 id="previous-attempts"><a class="anchor" href="#previous-attempts"></a>Previous Attempts</h5>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The two problems outlined above caused that the test coverage of our
      plugins is rather low. We always knew this sucked and there have been
      attempts to change that.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>A <code>ComponentTest</code> class used in some of our plugins is an attempt at
      testing the plugins out-of-container, bootstrapping them with some
      required input. Advantage of this approach is that you don&#8217;t need to
      care about the plugin container and its intricacies, disadvantage being
      that you don&#8217;t get to test your plugin in an environment it will be
      deployed to. Also, you need to implement support for bootstrapping the
      parameters for any plugin facet your plugin implements - in the end
      you&#8217;d end up reimplementing large parts of the plugin container just for
      the testing needs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Another attempt was the <code>@PluginContainerSetup</code> annotation that took
      care of the configuration and lifecycle of the plugin container. The
      advantage was that you got access to a real plugin container running
      with your plugins, disadvantage being that you still were required to
      perform some maven and antrun artistry so that the plugin container
      could find all the plugins and libraries you&#8217;d need.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect4">
      <h5 id="enter-arquillian"><a class="anchor" href="#enter-arquillian"></a>Enter Arquillian</h5>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>As I already hinted at above, the RHQ agent shares a lot of similarities
      with EE/Servlet containers from the deployment point of view. Arquillian
      was therefore an obvious choice to try and solve our plugin test
      problems once and for all (well, this is a lie - the problem with having
      to have a managed resource available for the test is a problem that
      cannot be reasonably solved using a single solution).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>So what is this integration about? It certainly won&#8217;t help you, as the
      plugin developer, with connecting to a managed resource you&#8217;re creating
      your plugin for. But it <strong>does</strong> bring you a lot of convenience over the
      previous state of things if you want to test your plugin in container.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Most importantly there is no more any maven and/or antrun required to
      test your plugin in-container. You just define your plugin in the
      Arquillian way using the <code>@Deployment</code> annotation (and you can "attach"
      to it any another plugins it depends on by instructing Arquillian to use
      the maven resolver). Using <code>arquillian.xml</code> (yes, a configuration file
      but an order of magnitude shorter and much more focused and simple than
      <code>pom.xml</code>), you can configure your container to use RHQ&#8217;s native APIs by
      flipping one config property to true. You can declaratively say you want
      to run discovery of managed resources (using, surprise, a
      <code>@RunDiscovery</code> annotation) and you get get results of such discovery
      injected into a field in your test class. You can even set the container
      up so that it thinks it is connected to an RHQ server and you can
      provide your <code>ServerServices</code> implementation (i.e. the RHQ server facade
      interface) and there is a default implementation ready that uses Mockito
      to mock your serverside. There&#8217;s still more, you can read all about the
      supported features and see some examples on
      <a href="http://wiki.rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Arquillian+Integration+For+Agent+Plugins">this
      wiki page</a>.</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect4">
      <h5 id="conclusion"><a class="anchor" href="#conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h5>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>While not a panacea for all problems the testing of RHQ plugins brings
      about, using Arquillian we were able to cut the setup needed to run a
      plugin in-container by 90% and we were able to introduce a number of
      convenience annotations using which you can get a variety of data
      injected into your unit tests. This is still just a beginning though,
      the next step is to start actually using this integration and come up
      with other useful annotation and/or helper methods/classes that will
      ease the working with and retrieving information from the plugin
      container as much as possible.</p>
