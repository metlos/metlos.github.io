      <p>Humans make mistakes. That&#8217;s because they learn and by making mistakes
      and experimenting they perfect their skills. Computers on the other hand
      only do as they are told. When a human interacts with the computer, she
      expects the computer to be human-like to the extent that it can recover
      or react to the mistakes she makes while learning the rules of
      interaction with it.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In case of <a href="http://www.rhq-project.org">RHQ</a> one of the users is a plugin
      developer. An RHQ (agent) plugin is a "thing" that talks to some other
      software and can configure and monitor it. The other type of the RHQ
      user is the system administrator that uses RHQ and its plugins to manage
      their IT infrastructure. For the administrator, the plugin becomes part
      of the "computer". But the plugin is made by humans and humans make
      mistakes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>One of the mistakes the plugin developer can make is to assign a wrong
      "resource key" during the discovery of resources. A resource key is
      something that uniquely identifies the particular "resource" the plugin
      can talk to. You can dive much deeper into the details of this
      <a href="http://rhq-project.org/display/RHQ/Writing+Custom+Plugins#WritingCustomPlugins-Identity">here</a>
      but in a nutshell, the resource key is extracted from the data the
      plugin can gather about a resource in such a way that if at some later
      point in time the plugin is told to rediscover the resources it can
      manage, the resource key will remain the same for the same resources.
      Usually, the resource key is a file-system location of some significant
      configuration file, an installation directory, a port a service is
      listening on, a CPU id, a mount point, etc. Whatever fits the need of
      the particular plugin.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>If the plugin developer realized she made a mistake in the way the
      resource key is generated and that it for example doesn&#8217;t identify the
      resource in a completely unique way, the only thing she could do is to
      create a new version of the plugin with the fix and distribute it to her
      customers. Easy.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>But the consequences for the customers (i.e. the system administrators)
      were quite severe. Because the resource key algorithm changed, the
      resources that they already had in their inventories and that they
      managed, collected stats on, had alerts defined for, etc. suddenly
      became defunct and a new resource (or even more resources, with the new
      resource keys) appeared in their place. The administrator would then
      have to go and define their alerts, add the new resource(s) to the
      groups they defined for them, etc. all over again. Not to mention the
      fact the historical data would from now on be split between the "old"
      and "new" resource so if the admin wanted to retain the historical data
      they could not just delete the defunct resource. They&#8217;d have to keep it
      in their inventory in which the resource would forever stay in
      unavailable state showing red icons signifying a problem where there
      wouldn&#8217;t be any (well, the problem was on the plugin developer side, but
      the admin would suffer for it).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p><strong>But all that changed.</strong> Yesterday, I merged in a new feature that
      enables the plugin developers to fix their past mistakes in a way that
      the system admins wouldn&#8217;t be punished for.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>I called the process "resource upgrade" because it enables the plugin
      developers to change the data of the existing resources to "upgrade"
      them so that they conform to the latest version of the plugin code. For
      now the feature is quite rudimentary and only enables to upgrade the
      resource key, resource name and description. Obviously, the other big
      candidates for upgrade would be the plugin configuration (aka connection
      settings) and resource configuration. When we were thinking about this
      though we realized that not only would implmenenting the configuration
      upgrades be quite complex because we would basically have to break the
      fundamental principle of RHQ configuration which is that the RHQ server
      is the authoritative source of configuration data, but we couldn&#8217;t find
      a plugin that would benefit from such capability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>If you happen to have a custom RHQ plugin for your piece of software and
      say to yourself, damn, why oh why didn&#8217;t they think about my use case,
      I&#8217;d love to be able to upgrade the configuration of existing resources,
      please leave a comment here. I&#8217;d love to hear about your needs so that
      we can think about supporting them in the future.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
      <p>When I said that the resource upgrade supports upgrading the resource
      name and description I partially lied though. The actual update of these
      is guarded by a server configuration setting because both resource name
      and description can be updated by the users and we wouldn&#8217;t want to
      overwrite their updates without consent. For now there is even no way to
      enable that setting in the UI even though it&#8217;d be trivial to add. The
      problem with this is that for this feature to be useful to our current
      community and customers, we&#8217;d have to update all the plugins with code
      that would implement it which becomes a substantial amount of work with
      our 30+ plugins at the moment. But if you feel like you absolutely need
      this, contact our team. Anything is possible when there&#8217;s enough backing
      ;)</p>
