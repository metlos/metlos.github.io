Just a short note about the useful git aliases I've came up with during
the course of my daily work with git and github.

Although it's been done by different people several times, I also came up
with some shortcuts to work with github's pull requests from the 
commandline. I tend to use github's website only for commenting on the pull
requests but I like to do the rest locally in my repository (including the
merge of the pull request). Checkout this 
https://gist.github.com/metlos/9368527[gist] where I keep my aliases.
